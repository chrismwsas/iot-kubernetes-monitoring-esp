## Overview

The current Viya4 monitoring solution provides system administrators with a powerful tool to monitor installations as a whole. Resource oversight, coupled with the ability to aggregate log information and generate alerts make it easier to admnister deployments regardless of their complexity. While this is helpful at a high level, within Viya, smaller ecosystems like the SAS Event Stream Processing (SAS ESP) require a more specialized approach to  both real time and historical monitoring of projects.

The monitoring stack for SAS ESP was developed to help customers address this need. It can be considered as an extended version of the Viya4 monitoring solution, as it shares the same code base and allows for the installation of the same components in addition to SAS ESP-specific ones. The main difference is that the SAS ESP stack doesn't require the deployment of the Viya4 logging component as it uses Loki instead for log aggregation.

Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus, designed to be cost effective and easy to operate. Compared to other log aggregation systems, Loki:

```
1. does not index the contents of the logs, but accesses log streams through a set of predefined or user-defined labels.
2. indexes and groups log streams using the same labels as Prometheus, enabling users to seamlessly switch between metrics and logs.
3. is an especially good fit for storing Kubernetes Pod logs. Metadata such as Pod labels is automatically scraped and indexed.
4. has native support in Grafana, which means that Prometheus and Loki panels can coexist on the same dashboard.
```

A Loki-based stack consists of 3 components:

- Promtail, the agent responsible for gathering logs and sending them to Loki.
- The Loki server, responsible for storing logs and processing queries.
- Grafana, for querying and displaying the logs.

See the documentation at [SAS Viya: Monitoring](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=sasadmincdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=calmonitoring&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm)
for more information about using the monitoring components.

## Logging - Aggregation, Searching, & Filtering

  This is an example of OpenSearch Dashboards displaying log message volumes.

  ![OpenSearch Dashboards - Log Message Volume Dashboard](img/screenshot-logs-dashboard.png)

For information about the application components deployed by the log-monitoring solution, the prerequisites, and more, see [Getting Started](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=sasadmincdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=callogging&docsetTarget=p069v6xx0f500zn12n18vel967w3.htm) in the SAS Viya Administration Help Center.

## Installation

### Monitoring

See the [monitoring README](monitoring/README.md) to deploy the monitoring
components, including Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana,
metric exporters, service monitors, and custom dashboards.

### Logging

See the documentation at [SAS Viya: Logging](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=sasadmincdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=callogging&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm)
for information about deployment.

## Customization

For most deployment scenarios, the process of customizing the monitoring and
logging deployments consists of:

- creating the location for your local customization files
- using the `USER_DIR` environment variable to specify the location of the
  customization files
- copying the customization files from one of the provided samples to your
  local directory
- specifying customization variables and parameters in the customization files

Other scenarios use different customization steps that are specific to each scenario.

Samples are provided for several common deployment scenarios. Each sample
includes detailed information about the customization process and values for
the scenario.

See the [monitoring README](monitoring/README.md) and [SAS Viya: Logging](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=sasadmincdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=callogging&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm)
for detailed information about the customization process and about determining
valid customization values. See the README file for each [sample](samples/README.md)
for detailed information about customization for each deployment scenario.

### Default StorageClass

The default cluster StorageClass is used for both monitoring and logging
unless the value is overidden in the  `user-*.yaml` files for monitoring or
logging. The deployment scripts issue a warning if no default StorageClass is
available, even if the value is properly set by the user. In this case,
you can safely ignore the warning.
